/**
 * The one place a Session's decrypted metadata is rewritten to name a different
 * current Agent.
 *
 * Every consumer of that metadata resolves "which Agent is this Session?" from
 * the same three signals — declared `flavor`, the runtime descriptor, and the
 * flat per-Agent vendor resume keys — and
 * `buildInactiveSessionResumeSpawnOptions` REFUSES to build resume options when
 * those signals disagree (it requires exactly one identity candidate). So a
 * cutover that writes the target's identity without removing the source's key
 * produces a Session that still reports an Agent but can never be reactivated
 * from its own committed metadata. That failure is silent at the identity
 * resolver and loud only at resume, which is why the removal lives here, beside
 * the manifest that enumerates the keys, rather than in a caller.
 *
 * This projector is intentionally CLEAR-LIST driven rather than carry-list
 * driven: session metadata is an open record shared by many owners, so an
 * allow-list would silently drop unrelated facts (workspace location, handoff
 * lineage, fork/replay metadata) the transition must preserve. What it removes
 * is exactly the set of Agent-scoped facts and current-runtime projections that
 * describe a runtime which no longer exists.
