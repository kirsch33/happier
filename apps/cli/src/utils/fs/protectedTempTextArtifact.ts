 * Use when a subprocess flag must carry potentially large or private text (`--flag <text>`
 * vs `--flag <path>` where the tool re-reads an existing path): argv is process-list-visible
 * and subject to platform argument-length limits, while the protected file contents are not.
 *
 * The directory (0700) and file (0600) use the protected-local-state owners, including
 * Windows ACL handling. The artifact is retained until `cleanup()` — a reader that reloads
 * the file later (e.g. pi re-reads `--append-system-prompt` sources on resource reload)
 * keeps working for the whole subprocess lifetime. Callers clean up through their normal
 * terminal paths (dispose/exit), exactly like the Claude MCP config materializer.
