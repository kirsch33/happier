/**
 * `REQ-STATE-03` — the machine-local (Session, Agent) record's lifecycle.
 *
 * Two ratified obligations, and they are the whole of this file:
 *
 * 1. the recorded boundary advances ONLY once the provider accepted the context
 *    this activation handed the Agent, so a resume that failed before
 *    acceptance leaves the previously recorded boundary where it was;
 * 2. an identity that was offered for a native return and produced no accepted
 *    context is not recapturable as valid by a later departure.
 *
 * Plus the launch-policy split the same record depends on: a departure captures
 * a STRUCTURALLY valid identity, and whether that identity may be resumed is
 * decided at the RETURN, against the Account settings that hold then.
 *
 * The record store is the mocked boundary (protected files on disk). The
 * acceptance reading, the identity resolution and the eligibility decision are
 * code under test and run for real.
