/**
 * Same-Session cross-Agent continuation — the predecessor (minimum) vertical.
 *
 *   strict idle -> confirmed stop -> target current-view commit -> divider
 *   -> exact input into Pending custody -> fresh target activation
 *
 * A target that has run this Session on THIS machine before returns to the
 * native conversation it left: its vendor session id and the transcript head it
 * last saw are kept in a machine-local record written at its departure, the
 * current-view projector republishes that id as the target's single flat resume
 * key, and the Replay brief carries only the away-delta (`AM-24`, `AM-26`).
 * Every other target — including every target that never ran this Session — is
 * fresh: the source Agent's flat resume key is dropped by the projector and the
 * target starts from the FULL bounded Replay brief carried in
 * `metadata.replaySeedV1`, which the existing seed owner prefixes onto the first
 * provider-accepted prompt.
 *
 * There is no continuity proof and no pre-check of the recorded conversation: a
 * dead vendor id fails loudly at the first turn, exactly as any other Happier
 * resume does, and the user can switch back through the in-session picker.
 *
 * Two orderings differ from a naive reading of the design, and both are
 * deliberate predecessor contracts:
 *
 * 1. There is no epoch-scoped input-admission fence. `SessionProviderInputConsumer`
 *    has a one-way close latch and no reopen, so an epoch subsystem would be new
 *    machinery, not reuse. Strict idle is rechecked immediately before the stop
 *    instead; a final ordinary prompt that wins that instant begins and is then
 *    interrupted by the normal stop path.
 * 2. Input custody is taken BEFORE the target is started, because that is this
 *    tree's invariant at `sendSessionMessage`: starting a runtime with no
 *    durable Pending row creates work the user cannot recover. `accepted`
 *    therefore means canonical admission plus a started target, and a failure
 *    after admission is reported as `target_start_failed` rather than silently
 *    dropping the message.
 *
 * Every result reachable after the confirmed stop rides `partially_applied` or
 * `outcome_unknown`. `rejected` is used only where the source is provably still
 * running, because that arm's `sourceEffect: 'none'` is a promise the UI turns
 * into a keep-editing action.
