/**
 * Live eligibility for same-Session continuation on THIS machine.

 * submission that the daemon would then have to fail after stopping the source.
 *
 * The predecessor deliberately answers `false` to the depth flags rather than
 * "probably". Reporting a capability this tree does not have would let the UI
 * offer native return or a source-context spawn and then fail late.

/**
 * The single daemon-side answer to "does this Session have a canonical hosted
 * transcript the target Agent can continue from?" (section 2.3).
 *
 * Both transition entry points — inspection and the mutation — ask it here.
 * They previously each inlined `directSessionV1 !== undefined ||
 * transcriptStorage === 'direct'`, which is two more decision-makers for a
 * concept that already has a canonical Session-scoped owner, and which
 * disagreed with it: `getSessionStorageKind`
 * (apps/ui/sources/sync/domains/session/sessionStorageKind.ts) requires an
 * OBJECT with `v === 1` and defaults to `persisted`. A cleared `null`, a legacy
 * `{}`, or a future `{ v: 2 }` is persisted there and was "direct" here, so an
 * ordinary hosted Session silently became untransitionable — the same class of
 * defect as §1.5b, which made the picker unreachable on every ordinary Session.
 *
 * `transcriptStorage: 'direct'` is retained as a distinct, narrower arm: it is
 * the spawn INTENT recorded before `directSessionV1` is established (see
 * backends/opencode/utils/opencodeSessionIdMetadata.ts), so a Session that is
 * about to become direct also has no hosted transcript to hand over. That is a
 * different question from "what storage kind is this Session", which is why it
 * does not belong in the canonical storage-kind owner.
