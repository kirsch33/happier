/**
 * Every island the site has, in one map shared by all 21 entries.
 *
 * WHY ONE MAP AND NOT ONE PER PAGE. mountIslands only mounts containers the
 * page actually rendered, so a map naming an island that is not on this page
 * costs nothing at runtime — but a STATIC name does cost bytes, because it puts
 * the component in the entry's import graph. The trade is deliberate: the
 * alternative is 21 hand-maintained maps that drift from the pages they serve,
 * and the failure when they drift is a dead button — exactly the class of bug
 * this codebase spends its guards on. So: one map, with everything that is not
 * chrome behind `lazyIsland`.
 *
 * THE LAZY ONES ARE NOT IMPORTED AT THE TOP. That is the whole mechanism, and
 * it is easy to undo by accident — the first version of this file imported them
 * statically *as well*, which puts them in the entry chunk and makes the
 * dynamic import() a second copy rather than a saving.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE. ThemeToggle, HappierMark, LocaleSwitcher and
 * AnalyticsNotice are all interactive, and all live INSIDE Nav or Footer.
 * mountIslands skips a container with an island ancestor (see isNested), so the
 * outer island's React tree renders them and a second root never fights it for
 * the same nodes. Do not add them here.
 *
 * LocaleSuggestion is absent for a different reason: it renders nothing on the
 * server, so there is no container to find. src/entries/_mount.tsx gives it a
 * root of its own.
