/**
 * Opt-in live diagnostics for rare viewport defects (off unless the operator sets
 * `localStorage['happier.debug.viewportWrites'] = '1'` and reloads — same pattern as
 * `happier.debug.messageDecrypt` — or, on a native build, sets
 * `transcriptViewportDiagnosticsEnabled: true` inside the
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_HAPPIER_SYNC_TUNING_JSON` object).
 *
 * Two rare defect classes need a writer identified from a SINGLE in-the-wild
 * occurrence, because they do not reproduce on demand:
 * - the transcript sliding ~50-80px behind the composer on an idle session: every
 *   programmatic web scroll write flows through `writeWebScrollTopAndObserve`, so
 *   recording each write with its call stack either names the writer, or proves by
 *   absence that the slide was a LAYOUT shift (composer inset growth without scroll
 *   compensation) rather than a scroll write;
 * - the residual one-shot whole-transcript flicker: Legend's web build hides the list
 *   via container opacity, so timestamped opacity flips with the container's child
 *   count distinguish a data collapse from any other reset.
 *
 * Native has neither `localStorage` nor a DOM scroller to intercept, so its only
 * observation of viewport movement is the list's own `onScroll` offset; those samples
 * land in the same sink so a native capture is comparable to a web one.
 *
 * Findings land in `globalThis.__happierViewportDiagnostics` (bounded ring buffers) and
 * large jumps warn on the console with the captured stack.

/**
 * The held-intent ring is deeper than the others AND evicts by class, because its two event
 * populations differ by two orders of magnitude in rate and by everything in value.
 *
 * `landing-read` is emitted on EVERY settle frame — at 60Hz, once per animation frame — while
 * `residual-write` fires only when a correction is actually spent (fastest measured burst: 11
 * writes in 3.4s, UNIT M 2026-08-01). Under one flat 64-entry ring the reads buried the write
 * inside ~1s: a live census over 79 trials retained 2 140 `landing-read` (plus as many
 * adoption-probe reads, since retired with the stabilization corrector) and ZERO
 * `residual-write`, while the DOM instrument was recording those same writes (B2 §4.1,
 * 2026-08-06). The probe existed to attribute a write and could no longer hold one, which is
 * the same failure mode as an unarmed observer: an instrument that cannot see reports exactly
 * like a corridor that was quiet.
 *
 * So eviction is ordered by class, not by age alone: the oldest READ goes first, and a record
 * (write or lifecycle transition) is only dropped once the ring holds nothing else. One ordered
 * array is kept rather than parallel channels so a write stays interleaved with the reads that
 * explain it and no consumer has to merge two rings by timestamp.
 *
 * RETENTION at 512. Reads: bounded at 512 entries minus the resident records, so ~4.3s of
 * corrector activity at the 60Hz ceiling and longer whenever the settle cadence is not
 * saturated. Records: a write is now unevictable by any volume of reads, and 512 records is the
 * only bound — 160s at the fastest measured write rate if writes were the only record, less in
 * proportion to whatever `settle-request` traffic shares the budget (its live rate is not

/**
 * Arm (or re-arm) the transcript viewport observers on the scroller the app itself resolved.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A MOUNT-TIME EFFECT. The previous install ran once, in a `useEffect` whose
 * deps could not change, against whatever `readWebScrollMetrics()` resolved at mount. At that
 * instant the transcript content does not overflow yet, so the resolver's ancestor walk (or
 * its root fallback) hands back an element that is NOT the transcript scroller — in the live
 * capture, the 384px left-rail scroller. The effect then had no way to re-arm once the real
 * scroller attached, so the ring stayed pointed at the wrong element for the entire session.
 *
 * Calling this from the canonical resolution point instead means the observers follow the
 * app's own notion of "the transcript scroller" for free: identical element -> no work,
 * changed element -> dispose and re-arm, and a resolution that escaped the transcript root is
 * refused loudly rather than silently certifying an unrelated element's silence.
