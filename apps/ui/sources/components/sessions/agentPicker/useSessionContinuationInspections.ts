 * Live `session.continuation.inspect` answers for the targets one picker can offer.
 *
 * Three properties are deliberate.
 *
 * **Asked only where a switch is possible.** Every answer is per target, so the
 * caller narrows the question to the Sessions whose picker could actually offer
 * one: a closed gate, a read-only or external Session, an offline machine or a
 * Session with no other Agent asks nothing at all.
 *
 * **One runtime pair, one answer.** Answers are cached against the realtime
 * connection, the daemon generation, and the machine state they were read over,
 * and discarded when any of them changes, because inspection reserves nothing and
 * re-reading is the only way it stays true. Caching also matters for a negative:
 * the machine RPC already retries once on `METHOD_NOT_AVAILABLE`, so an old daemon
 * costs two round trips per ask.
 *
 * **Never asks a machine known to be offline.** That answer is already held, and
 * waiting out a transport timeout to rediscover it would leave the row reading
 * "checking" for no reason.
