 * inner shadow + cast shadow). This component owns only the floating *position*:
 * the side gutters, top/bottom gaps, and content max-width. Bars pass their tab

// Tuned to match the iOS 26 Liquid Glass tab bar: a capsule that *sizes to its
// content* and floats centered (deliberate negative space on the sides) rather
// than spanning the full width. `FLOATING_SIDE_GUTTER` is the minimum breathing
// room so a wide bar never touches the screen edges; the bar shrink-wraps its
// tabs and only compresses if it would exceed that bound.
// Large radius → clamps to a full capsule at any bar height (matches the iOS 26 /
// Instagram fully-rounded floating bar).
