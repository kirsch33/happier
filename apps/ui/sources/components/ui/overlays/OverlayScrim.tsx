/**
 * A short band of frost that sits directly on top of a bottom-anchored surface and clears within a
 * few dozen points.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a full-screen scrim. Veiling the whole app behind a composer is a sheet
 * with extra steps; this product's reason for a transparent presentation is that the session list
 * stays readable and monitorable WHILE you type. So the scrim's whole job is to seat the composer
 * against the content underneath it — to stop text colliding with text at the card's edge — and
 * then get out of the way.
 *
 * It is rendered in the composer's own slot, immediately above the card, rather than as a
 * full-bleed backdrop. That is what keeps it glued to the card at any composer height: the card
 * grows with chips, attachments and wrapped lines, and a bottom-anchored band of fixed height
 * would either be swallowed by a tall composer or float away from a short one.
 *
 * WHY THE BLUR IS THREE LAYERS AND NOT ONE
 *
 * Neither `expo-blur` nor `expo-glass-effect` has any gradient or variable-radius capability — the
 * iOS view is a plain `UIVisualEffectView`. A single masked blur is the tempting shortcut and the
 * documented failure: it "blooms", with a blurred-to-sharp transition that is nearly invisible.
 * Stacked constant-radius layers, each masked to its own band, are how a falloff is actually built.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE MAY ANIMATE EXCEPT THE WRAPPER'S OPACITY
 *
 * `expo-blur` allocates a fresh `UIViewPropertyAnimator` on every `intensity` write, `MaskedView`
 * on Android re-rasterises a full-size bitmap on every mask invalidation, and
 * `expo-linear-gradient` re-rasterises on every bounds change. Intensities, masks and bounds are
 * therefore all constant, and the single animated node is the opacity of the outer wrapper.
 *
 * ANDROID GETS THE DIM, NOT THE BLUR
 *
 * `expo-blur` resolves its blur root by walking up to the nearest react-native-screens `Screen`,
 * which for a modal is the modal's own transparent screen — it would blur nothing. That root
 * selection is deliberate upstream behaviour, not a bug to patch around.
