# Agent transition (same-Session cross-Agent continuation)

How one Happier Session changes the coding Agent that runs it, in place, without
forking and without changing the Session id.

Published, user-facing documentation for this feature lives at
`apps/docs/content/docs/sessions/continue-with-another-agent.mdx`. This page is
the internal contract: canonical owners, ordering, effect depth, and the
operator surface.

Related internal pages: `feature-gating.md` (gate contract), `protocol.md` (wire
transport), `pending-delivery.md` (input custody), `agents-catalog.md` (Agent
vocabulary).

## Vocabulary

- **Source Agent** — the Agent running the Session when the switch is submitted.
- **Target Agent** — the Agent the reader armed.
- **Cutover** — the single server-side commit that moves the Session's current
  view onto the target Agent and writes the transcript divider.
- **Activation brief** — the bounded backward context pass handed to the target
  Agent through the existing Replay seed slot.
- **Native return** — a target Agent that already ran this Session on this
  machine resuming its own vendor conversation instead of starting fresh.

This is not session handoff, which moves a Session between machines and keeps
the Agent, and not forking, which creates a new Session.

Machine RPCs (`packages/protocol/src/rpc.ts`, registered in
`apps/cli/src/api/machine/rpcHandlers.ts`):

- `session.continuation.inspect` — read-only eligibility for one target.
- `session.agentTransition` — the mutation.
- `session.agentTransition.briefPreview` — read-only rebuild of a divider's brief.

All three run on the machine the client addresses, and the daemon does **not**
gate them on the Session's recorded machine id.

That gate was removed deliberately. A machine id is only a PROXY for "can this
Session be continued here", and every failure the gate claimed to prevent is
already detected by the component that actually knows: `requestSessionStop`
finds no local process for a Session that is not here and reports it, the
per-Agent native-return record is DEVICE-LOCAL so its absence already degrades
to a full replay, the cutover is server-side and machine-agnostic, and
activating the target on this host succeeds or fails loudly. The proxy was also
wrong in both directions — it refused a user who had legitimately moved a
Session to this host, while still admitting a same-id Session whose vendor
conversation had been deleted — so it removed real capability to prevent
nothing, and it cost one Account-scoped machine-replacement read per inspected
target.

The user's machine-replacement ruling — replacing a machine must not strand the
Sessions the previous one hosted — therefore holds **by construction** here:
nothing in the transition path can refuse a replaced machine. `Session` rows are
never re-homed, so a recorded host stays the predecessor forever, and that no
longer matters.

The inactive goal, catalog and usage-limit controls keep their own locality gate
(`resolveMachineControlLocalityProof`,
`apps/cli/src/session/machineControlLocality.ts`). That is a different question:
those controls read and write the Session's WORKSPACE FILESYSTEM and vendor
config, so a daemon that is not the host would answer from its own filesystem —
silently and plausibly wrong — rather than fail loudly.

A not-here Session reaches the stop and comes back `not_found`. Since `AM-27`
that is no longer `outcome_unknown`: the stop owner classifies it, and when the
canonical Session row is observed inactive it reports the confirmed
`already_stopped` arm, so the transition proceeds normally. The fix is at the
stop owner, not a machine guess in the coordinator.

Inspection and the preview grant no authority and persist nothing; the mutation
revalidates every fact inspection reported.

## Preconditions

`inspectSessionContinuation` and `runSessionAgentTransition` share their
decisions so a selection cannot pass inspection and then be refused at cutover.

A Session is transitionable when all of these hold:

- it has a non-empty workspace `path` in metadata;
- `resolveAgentIdFromSessionMetadata` can name its current Agent;
- `hasCanonicalHostedTranscript(metadata)` is true — i.e. neither an established
  `directSessionV1` (`{ v: 1, ... }`) nor a recorded `transcriptStorage:
  'direct'` spawn intent. A direct/external-transcript Session has no Happier
  conversation for another Agent to continue.

A target is supported when `resolveSessionContinuationTargetAgent` resolves it:
the selection carries no `providerConnectionId`, the `agentId` is in
`CATALOG_AGENT_IDS`, and it is not `customAcp` (configured ACP targets are
excluded in V1 — their create/resume/context contract is unproven). A target
equal to the current Agent is reported as available-but-not-a-transition
(`sameSessionTransition: false`), not as an error.

The client adds two Session-level facts before it asks a machine anything
(`resolveSessionAgentContinuationSessionReason`): no edit access → `read_only`;
`storageKind === 'direct'` → `external_session`. Non-`builtInAgent` catalog rows
resolve to `target_not_proven` locally.

## Flow

Numbered stages match the section comments in the coordinator.

**7.1 Preflight (no effects).** Resolve the Session, refuse archived Sessions,
decrypt metadata, apply the preconditions above. Resolve the target *before*
comparing against the expected current Agent, so a Session that already **is**
the target is recognised as this operation's own committed cutover seen again
(7.5) rather than as a stale client view. Sanitize the submitted input through
`sanitizeSessionUserMessageSendMeta` here, before the idle proof, so a rejected
mention or attachment fails with the source untouched.

**Strict idle.** `waitForSessionIdle` with the session-control stop timeout.
Not idle within that window → `rejected('source_not_idle')`. There is
deliberately **no** input-admission fence: `SessionProviderInputConsumer` has a
one-way close latch and no reopen, so an epoch subsystem would be new machinery.
Currentness is rechecked immediately before the stop instead; a final ordinary
prompt that wins that instant begins and is then interrupted by the normal stop
path.

**7.2 Departure record and stop.** Recheck `metadataVersion`, then capture the
departing Agent's native resume record (its vendor id plus the transcript head
*before* the stop — under-estimating that boundary costs one re-replayed turn,
over-estimating skips rows permanently). Then `requestSessionStop`.

- Stop request failed before any attempt → `rejected('source_stop_failed')`
  (the source is provably still running).
- Stop attempted but not confirmed → `outcome_unknown`. There is no allowlist of
  "pre-signal" stop reasons; the reasons are diagnostic only.
- Confirmed → proceed. Confirmed is `isSessionStopConfirmed(stop)`, the predicate
  exported beside `SessionStopResult`, and it covers two results: `stopped: true`
  and the `already_stopped` outcome. Both mean the canonical Session row was
  observed inactive — the first after signalling a runtime, the second after
  finding none to signal. The coordinator never reads `stop.stopped` or a status
  string itself; liveness is one fact with one owner (`AM-27`).

**7.3 Project the target view.** Re-read the Session *after* the confirmed stop
and project from **those** bytes, because the CAS versions committed below come
from the same read. Resolve native-return eligibility first, then build the
activation brief bounded by the post-stop transcript head. The projection is
authoritative over `metadata.replaySeedV1`: either this operation's brief
occupies the slot or the slot is deleted. `applyTargetConnectedServiceBinding`
then resolves the target's connected-service binding through the same
account-default owner a new Session uses, minting a fresh materialization
identity; failure here degrades to native CLI auth rather than failing a
transition whose source is already gone.

**Cutover.** `commitSessionAgentTransitionCutover` commits the target current
view (CAS on `metadataVersion`/`agentStateVersion`), then appends the divider
through the canonical message owner. Missing, conflicting, unreadable, or
unverifiable divider evidence after that committed view maps to the one public
`divider_unavailable` result; storage-specific evidence stays internal.

**7.4 Admit input, then activate.** Input custody is taken **before** the target
runtime is started, matching this tree's `sendSessionMessage` invariant:
starting a runtime with no durable Pending row creates work the user cannot
recover. `accepted` therefore means canonical admission **plus** a started
target; a failure after admission is `target_start_failed`, never a silent drop.

**7.5 Reconciliation.** A retry that finds the Session already naming the target
runs `reconcileAlreadyTargetedSession`, sharing the same activation/admission
implementation. Only a request that *also* expected the target is a genuine
`same_target` no-op.

### Result arms

`beginSessionAgentTransitionEffects` is a per-invocation effect ledger, and the
handle in scope is the only source of result arms.

- `rejected` is used **only** where the source is provably still running — its
  `sourceEffect: 'none'` is a promise the banner can state without offering a
  recovery action.
- Everything reachable after the confirmed stop rides `partially_applied`
  (`source_stopped` / `current_view_committed` depths) or `outcome_unknown`.
- `accepted` means the current view and divider committed and the exact
  submitted input was admitted.

## Recovery presentation

The client automatically reconciles canonical Session and input-custody facts,
then presents the outcome through the existing composer
`SessionWarningActionBanner`. It has no *Check status*, *Resume source*, or
*Resume target* control, no recovery panel, polling, status RPC, or second
recovery state machine. `rejected` and `source_stopped` show no action;
`outcome_unknown` is a neutral notice while that one reconciliation runs; and
`current_view_committed` may offer the existing **Resume session** action only
when the Session is already the target and inactive. For `target_start_failed`,
the exact message is already queued and will be delivered when the Session
resumes, so the banner must never tell the reader to send it again.

### Correlation and idempotency

The submitted user-message `localId` is the single correlation key for the whole
transition. The divider's localId is derived from it
(`agent-transition:{submittedLocalId}`), which makes the divider exactly-once
with no receipt or marker persisted. The client mints that id per *armed choice*
— stable across re-renders and across an edited draft, replaced when the reader
picks a different Agent, model, mode or configuration — so retrying the same
armed switch re-admits one message instead of sending a second copy.

Encrypted divider content is derived deterministically from the localId, so a
retry re-derives byte-identical content and the message owner reconciles it as
the same row.

## What the arriving Agent receives

The brief is produced by `buildSessionAgentTransitionActivationBrief`, which
composes the transition-specific inputs and delegates retrieval, budget,
escaping and framing to the canonical Replay seed owner. It is carried in
`metadata.replaySeedV1` and prefixed onto the first provider-accepted prompt by
the existing seed owner; `seedText` is blanked the instant the target accepts it.

The frame is built with continuity `same_session_agent_change` — deliberately
not `previous_session`, which would print this Session's own id as its
predecessor. It can contain:

- a handoff header naming the situation and the source Agent, plus the Session
  title;
- for a fresh target, an explicit statement that the previous Agent's own
  conversation state does not carry over and the transcript below is a replay;
- an optional condensed summary block;
- the departing Agent's tracked work (`sessionWorkStateV1`), read through
  `readDisplayableSessionWorkStateV1`, attributed to that Agent and marked
  past-tense because the cutover cleared the field;
- the last user instruction, pinned when it falls outside the replayed window;
- the transcript tail;
- a replay-completeness notice when some rows could not be read;
- retrieval pointers — the Happier transcript-retrieval invocation for the
  target Agent, and the source Agent's own session-log path when one exists and
  the file is still present (resolved from the catalog-declared log-path slot
  first, then the provider-owned `resolveAgentNativeSessionLogPath` hook). That
  slot is still spelled `vendorResumeContinuityProofField` in the catalog,
  pending a generated-projection rename; it is a **log-path pointer**, not a
  continuity proof — the proof mechanism is removed and nothing gates on it.

The pass is bounded by **characters**, not message count.

An empty source (a Session where the reader switches before sending anything)
is `no_source_dialog`, which is a success with nothing to carry — not
`context_unavailable`.

## Native return

`agentNativeReturn.ts` keeps a **machine-local** record of each departing
Agent's vendor conversation id and the transcript head it had seen, because a
vendor session belongs to the machine that ran it.

When a target with such a record is chosen again on that machine:

- `evaluateVendorResumeEligibility` — the same owner the ordinary
  inactive-resume path consults — decides usability against the exact projected
  target view the cutover is about to commit and against this Account's
  settings (which carry per-Agent native-resume enablement and the Codex backend
  mode). Unavailable settings read as no explicit enablement: fail closed.
- The resume id travels through `projectCurrentAgentSessionView`
  (`nativeResumeId`), the one writer of a flat vendor resume key, which is what
  keeps the one-identity invariant true by construction.
- The brief then carries only the **away-delta** since that Agent's recorded
  departure, and the frame states the boundary instead of restating history the
  resumed conversation already holds.

**Strict native-identity acceptance.** The recorded boundary advances only once
the provider accepts the requested resumed identity, including an activation
with no replay seed. Prompt transport and replay-seed retirement are separate
facts: neither alone proves that the requested native identity was accepted. A
failed strict return leaves the earlier boundary unchanged and invalidates that
identity so it cannot be recaptured as valid for this Session and Agent. This
adds no proof file, `stat()`, read-back, polling, TTL, or second native-session
registry.

There is deliberately **no** continuity proof, `stat()`, or liveness probe on
the recorded id. A stale or dead vendor session fails loudly at the first turn —
Claude raises `ClaudeAgentSdkResumeIdentityMismatchError`, Codex's
`thread/resume` throws with no fresh-start fallback — which is the same contract
every other Happier resume already has. The reader recovers through the
in-session picker.

Anything refused degrades to a fresh target with the **full** bounded brief,
never to an arbitrary native session and never to a starved replay. A target
with no record passes `returningAgentLastSeenSeq: null` and cannot be starved,
because there is no bound to starve it with.

## Divider and the rebuilt context card

The divider is stored as an ordinary `type: 'message'` agent event carrying a
strict sidecar (`SessionAgentTransitionDividerV1Schema`: `fromAgentId`,
`toAgentId`, `sourceCutoffSeqInclusive`), so a reader predating the feature
still shows truthful prose. `readSessionAgentTransitionDividerV1` is the single
"is this a divider?" reader — attention resolvers, the separator renderer,
historical attribution and the bounded context pass all use it.

Both Agent ids are durable and may outlive the catalog; an unknown id degrades
to itself rather than to "Unknown".

`sourceCutoffSeqInclusive` is **required**, not optional. `0` is a recorded
"nothing was carried over"; a sidecar that omits the field fails the strict parse
and the row is not a divider at all — it degrades to its stored prose through the
same path a reader predating the feature takes. Nothing of this feature is in a
released build (`git grep sessionAgentTransitionV1` is empty at `cli-stable`,
`cli-preview`, `server-stable` and `ui-web-stable`), so the cutoff-less shape an
intermediate development build wrote is not an obligation and there is no
"recorded no bound" reader state.

Nothing of the brief is stored to show later: `replaySeedV1.seedText` is blanked
on acceptance and the metadata record keeps one seed per Session, so a
twice-switched Session has already lost the first. The card therefore
**rebuilds** on open, on the hosting machine, through
`session.agentTransition.briefPreview` → the *same*
`buildSessionAgentTransitionActivationBrief`, bounded by the *same* cutoff the
divider recorded. Running it client-side from the rendered transcript would
create a second decision-maker about what the Agent was sent.

Two components are deliberately **omitted** from a rebuild and stated as omitted
in the card, rather than refilled from today's values: the departing Agent's
tracked work and its own session log. Both are Agent-scoped current state whose
durable keys now hold the *incumbent's* values, so the rebuild passes
`departingAgentCurrentView: null`. This is why a rebuild can legitimately differ
from what was sent, and why the card says so.

Preview outcomes: `rebuilt` (with `briefText`), `empty` (nothing was carried
over), `unavailable` with `unsupported_session` (not retryable) or
`source_unreadable`.

## Client behaviour

- The picker is the running Session's Agent/engine picker in the composer. Each
  target row carries its own model/mode/config choice, rendered by the same
  owner New Session uses (`buildSessionAgentPickerDetailContent`).
- **Selection is arming**: there is no confirm step, and re-selecting the
  running Agent's row is the cancel gesture. Nothing is sent until the next
  message.
- The arm is scoped to `{feature gate open} × {rail offered} × {sessionId} ×
  {current Agent}`. Any of those moving discards the arm, including the
  persisted copy in the Session draft. A restored arm is re-validated against a
  *settled* rail — an unresolved gate looks exactly like a closed one and is
  never treated as proof of staleness.
- Rows still being inspected are held in the same restrained treatment as
  unavailable rows, so nothing can be armed before its machine has answered.
- One send has one destination (`resolveSessionComposerSendDestination`). It
  refuses rather than silently mis-delivering: `conflictingDestination` (the
  send would reach a voice adapter or execution run), `armedTargetUnreachable`
  (no machine), `unreconciledTransitionOutcome` (an earlier `outcome_unknown`
  window is still open).
- Inspection answers are keyed on both the client's connection generation and
  the machine's daemon generation; either moving discards every prior answer.
- `resolveSessionContinuationUnavailablePresentationV1` splits an
  operation-unavailable answer by machine presence: offline → `machine_offline`,
  online → `update_cli`, otherwise → `update_or_reconnect`. An inspection call
  that failed without establishing anything is `indeterminate` and presents as
  `update_or_reconnect`, never as a false "update the CLI" instruction.

## Feature gate and configuration

`sessions.agentSwitching` (`packages/protocol/src/features/catalog.ts`):
`representation: 'server'`, `defaultFailMode: 'fail_closed'`, depends on
`sessions`. The UI consumes it as `readServerEnabledBit(...) === true` at the
one place a target can be armed, so a closed gate means no inspection, no rail,
and no armed intent — and the submit path reads only the armed intent.

Server env (`apps/server/sources/app/features/catalog/featureEnvSchema.ts`,
`readFeatureEnv.ts`):

- `HAPPIER_FEATURE_SESSIONS_AGENT_SWITCHING__ENABLED` — parsed with a `true`
  default, so this is an **opt-out**. The feature is on unless an operator
  turns it off.

Daemon env (`apps/cli/src/configuration.ts`) — these bound the shared Replay
seed pass, so they also affect forking and source-context spawns:

- `HAPPIER_REPLAY_MAX_SEED_CHARS` — default `120000`, min `1024`, max `200000`.
  The minimum is not a round number: the prompt builder's frame floor is 814
  characters (pinned in `happierReplayPrompt.spec.ts`), and below that floor the
  builder correctly returns **no** seed rather than a frame with no transcript
  under it. `1024` sits above the measured floor with room to grow, so a clamped
  value can always deliver a real prompt. A caller-supplied `maxSeedChars` on
  the wire is not clamped here and may be lower.
- `HAPPIER_REPLAY_SEED_CANDIDATE_LIMIT` — default `500`, min `50`, max `500`.
- `HAPPIER_REPLAY_SEED_MAX_TRANSCRIPT_REQUESTS` — default `8`, min `1`, max `24`.
- `HAPPIER_REPLAY_SEED_TRANSCRIPT_DEADLINE_MS` — default `15000`, min `1000`,
  max `120000`. This walk runs after the source runtime is stopped and while the
  user is waiting.

## Compatibility

- The public transition union names a committed view whose divider is missing,
  conflicting, unreadable, or unverifiable as
  `partially_applied / current_view_committed / divider_unavailable`. Exact
  storage evidence remains internal because it does not change recovery.
- A lost cutover CAS is retried EXACTLY once, after refetching the row and
  re-proving that it is unarchived and still on the source Agent. The target view
  is re-projected from the refetched bytes, so the retry cannot revert the write
  that moved the version. A second loss is a conflict, not a loop.
- A daemon that predates the operation cannot answer
  `session.continuation.inspect`; the client presents that by machine presence
  rather than asserting a cause.
- The divider is an ordinary agent message event, so a client that does not
  understand the sidecar still renders truthful prose instead of nothing.
- Native-return records are machine-local and are not part of any wire or
  cross-machine contract.
